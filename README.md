# LD34_anglerfish
Beware this project was created within 48h (during Ludum dare 34) and I made a lot of ugly stuff in the code due to the focus was to be done by the game in time. So for any future employer, this is not how my code looks like regularly ;)

This is a libgdx project which uses gradle.
Please refer to https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/documentation.html for set enviroment up.
